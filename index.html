            <p>                                                                                                     By Paxton McKee

                In a place beyond an endless sky, a woman in a simple white dress found herself standing in a strange place. The ground was like water, and the sky painted a 
                vibrant orange, and a passionate red. The ground reflected the eternal sunset, and the woman couldn’t tell where the sky ends and the floor began. Almost 
                everywhere she looked, she only saw the colors of a low sky, and almost everywhere she walked, she noticed delicate ripples would radiate out, getting weaker 
                and weaker the further they went. However, there was something that caught her attention. In the distance was a forest, with the all trees being the same height,
                 like a wall around a castle. With the wall of trees being the only form of shelter, she began to walk towards them, with the water ripples following her every 
                 step. The closer she got to the trees, the figure of a man came into her view, and the closer she got, the more she could make out. The man was older, wearing 
                 an unzipped winter jacket and jeans, and under the jacket was a plaid dress shirt. When she got into speaking range, the man spoke. 
                 “Well now, we don’t get a lot of visitors round these parts often.”
            The woman didn’t know how to respond. She didn’t know why, but she felt that she knew who the old man was, so she decided to inquire about the situation. “What is 
            this place?”
            “This is our temporary home,” the man responded.
            “Why is it temporary, and what to you mean ‘our’?”
            The man chuckled. “Because you and I are here to fulfill our role, given to us by Him.”
            “Him? Who’s Him?” She questioned.
            “Oho ho ho,” the man softly laughed. After a short pause, he began again.
            “You’ll find out in due time,” he gave her a soft smile. “For now though, come, I’ll will show you to our home.” The man turned around and began to walk deeper 
            into the forest, like a cryptic messenger. The woman stood there for a while, wondering if she should follow. After all, there didn’t seem to be any other location 
            she could use as shelter. As the man continued to blend into the trees of the forest, the woman took a chance, and decided to follow.
            The woman took in her surroundings as she followed the man. The trees around her had needly leaves and towered above her, almost touching the heavens. All of the 
            trees were the same height and same distance apart from one another. The woman also felt that the ground was different. Instead of the ripples and the feeling of 
            water, the ground was soft and green. After taking in the trees, she noticed the man entered what appeared to be a clearing, waiting for her. “Here we are,” the 
            man said. “Welcome to our temporary home.” A few steps later, the woman exited the forest, and her eyes widened, processing the sight before her. Unlike the sparse 
            and emptiness of the mirrored sky, the clearing was alive. There was a large hill off in the distant left, covered in a sea of flowers, with a domineering tree 
            standing like a king, its leaves long and droopy. In the same direction as the tree, but closer to her was a building that looked like a cottage, with a tower 
            connecting to it. To her right was a medium-sized orchard, and in the distance in front of her was a large lake, with the flower hill flattening out the closer 
            it got to the lake. “Well, what do you think of the Eden He has created?” The man’s question brought her back.
                “It’s beautiful,” she said with an open smile and glee, accepting the words he said. She wanted to explore this new place, but the man anticipated this.
                “I was like that the first time I came here, but we can save that for tomorrow.” The man then began to walk towards the cottage, while the woman asked a 
                question after a few moments, oblivious to his actions.
                “Tomorrow? Why tomorrow?” 
                The man didn’t have to respond, as the woman noticed that the red orange started to accept indigo and purple into its warmth, and the moon began to peak its 
                curious eye over the wall of trees. She then noticed the man had walked away, towards the cottage, and decided to follow him, her only guide to this place.
                The cottage was small in size, with a cream-colored coating, accentuated by the natural cherrywood frame around the doors and windows. The roof was a similar
                 color to the sunset she saw earlier, and was made of steeply layered shingles, almost like it was trying to pierce the sky. Vines and ivy climbed up the cottage
                  in various places, giving it an earthly feel. While standing a short distance from the front door, she looked at the tower connected to the cottage. The tower
                   was a fair bit taller than the peak of the roof and had a balcony with a telescope pointed towards the clouds above. The roof of the tower was the same as
                    the cottage, sharing its color and purpose. Opposite the tower stood a stone chimney, fit with moss growing on the base, but shorter compared to its towering
                     rival. To the woman, the cottage was directly out of a fairytale, albeit one she couldn’t quite remember. She stood there for a few moments, neck craned 
                     towards the rounded point of the tower, while the old man had already entered the home. As the sky became dominated by purple and the orange began to flee,
                      the smell of a fire brought her back to the open door. With soft steps, the woman entered the cottage, and her eyes were drawn to the man tending to the
                       fire in the fireplace. “Go ahead and make yourself comfortable,” said the crouched man as he wielded the poker against the warming flames. “This is your 
                       home too after all.” 
                With an affirmative nod, she began to look around. She noticed a the couch to the left of the fireplace. Deciding to sit down, she walked over to the couch. 
                The man put down the poker after a few moments, stood up, and began walking towards the door opposite the fireplace. “I’ll go get us some refreshments.” The 
                man entered what she could only assume was the kitchen, and while she waited, she looked around once more. On her right, the wall was decorated with even more
                   fairytale like details, with delicately painted china plates and a beautifully created seaside landscape enclosed by a wood frame filling the space. The wall
                   decorations softly embraced the warm light from the fireplace, and the fireplace itself hugged the wall tightly, like a child with their favorite stuffed 
                   animal. To her left was the door that the man went through, with a coat rack and a bench standing guard. What caught her eye, however, was the bookshelves 
                   across from her, separated by a window. Curious, she rose from her brief rest and decided to skim the spines to see if there was anything interesting to pass
                   the time. As her finger traced the changes of depth in the books, titles like The History of Atlantis, Movie Trivia Vol. XII, and Astrid’s Favorite People, 
                   Places, and Things, stood out to her. 
                While engrossed in titles, the old man entered with two mugs. “Here you go,” he said with a smile partially obscured by a white beard and mustache, mug 
                extended towards her. She stood up and accepted the mug he held out with a cautious “Thank you.” Her eyes moved back and forth, from the mug’s contents, 
                and the old man blowing the steam away. “Don’t worry,” he noticed. “It’s hot chocolate.”  She looked at her mug after his comment, and after pushing her 
                platinum blonde hair to the side, she slowly drank from it, and he was right, it was hot chocolate. While she had just begun her drink, the man polished 
                off his drink with a vigorous “Ahh!”, which truly caught her off guard.
                As she began to drink her hot chocolate more and more, her gaze moved towards the window, painted in the mysteries of the night. “It seems pretty late out,”
                she said.
                “I suppose so,” he responded. 
                After an awkward silence, he asked, “So, do you remember anything?”
                She turned to him, slightly confused about his question.
                “You know, something like a name, or a reason as to why you’re here?”
                With that clarification, she tried to think of something. Her name or the reason why she was here were questions she didn’t remember the answers to, 
                but strangely, she felt that she was meant to be there, that she had a purpose. To that end, she responded with the best answer she could. “I’m sorry I
                don’t remember anything, but something in my heart is telling me that I need to be here.”
                “I see.” 
                With his question finally answered, he changed the topic. “Well, I’ll show you a spare room that you can use.”
                “Are you sure, I don’t want to impose.”
                “You don’t have to worry about that, you’ve had a long day after all,” he responded to her worries. “Plus, I’d feel bad if you had just shown up here 
                and had nowhere to stay.”
                She pondered for a few moments before mentally agreeing with hime. There wasn’t anywhere outside she could stay, and the man seemed genuine in wanting 
                to help her, so she decided to take his offer with an “Ok.” 
                The man responded with another kind smile. “Well then, follow me.” He turned around and walked through the kitchen door, and she closely followed behind. 
                To her, it seemed like a regular kitchen, with the only odd piece standing out being a wooden spiral staircase opposite the door, and she assumed that it 
                led to the top of the tower she saw earlier. As they began to ascend, the creak of the wood and the feeling of cold wood against her feet gave it a homely 
                feel. At the top of the staircase was a small room with a door, and barely enough space for the two of them to stand. “Here we are,” he said. “Through there
                is the room where you will be staying.”
                A quick question came to her, “Where will you be staying?”
                “I’ll be fine on the couch. For now though, make yourself comfortable.”
                “Are you sure?”
                The man responded with a soft-hearted chuckle. “Don’t worry about it, I’ll be fine.” He began to work his way back to the main floor. “Make sure to get 
                plenty of rest, I’ll show you around tomorrow.”
                As the man continued downstairs, he let out a heavy breath, as she responded with “Good night.”
                “Good night,” said the man at the bottom of the stairs. 
                As he responded, she opened the door and walked into the room. In the room was a large bed, a desk with a chair, and a bench at the foot of the bed. 
                With the bed being the first thing she saw when she entered, she quickly noticed the two open-air balconies surrounding it. While the left balcony was 
                empty, the right one had a telescope on it. While she wished to explore, she suddenly felt tired, the day catching up to her, and decided to go to bed.
                While in bed, she began to reflect on her situation, with questions about the garden, the old man, and who He was. This reflection didn’t last long however,
                as her eyes became heavy and her thoughts began to flee from the tiredness.
                Sunlight crept into the room through the balconies, filling the room with a soothing warmth. Light over her closed eyes, the woman began to stir. In a
                groggy daze, she sat up in the bed, feeling refreshed, even though it felt like she fell asleep only a moment ago. As she sat, the stronger her eyelids 
                would get, and the more she began to move. The first thing she did after being awoken was to go to the balcony, taking in the morning sun. The sun was 
                    reaching its apex, watching the garden with its warm, yet constant gaze. Everywhere she looked, the sun’s light would bounce off the lake, always catching
                    her eye. The breeze also made its presence known, from the light sound as it went past her ears, to the somber shaking of the tree’s crying leaves. As a
                    small smile crept onto her face, she looked towards the orchard near the lake, where she saw the old man tending to the trees. While she watched the man
                    grab fruits and put them in the basket, she wondered how long he had been doing it for, and how many trees did he still have left to gather from. As he
                    moved from tree to tree, her resolve to go help him grew stronger, and once it reached its strongest yet, she went to join him.
                The orchard wasn’t too small or too big, it was perfectly medium sized. The trees were evenly spaced apart, and all bore the same purple fruit. By the time 
                the woman got there, the old man worked his way into the orchard, harvesting the bounty of the trees. While walking towards him, she soaked in the atmosphere, 
                while the breeze that became the leaves’ song, and the light from the sun warmed the cool feeling left by the breeze on her skin. Her steps slowed down, 
                fingers gently moving through the lowest branches, until she reached a low-hanging fruit. She stopped and felt the smooth, waxy skin. To her, it was soft,
                    yet firm, and at that moment, she realized she did not have breakfast. With delicate fingers, she freed the fruit from the tree’s hands, and looked at the
                    purple skin with blotches of the most vibrant dark blue she had ever seen. Not wanting to wait any longer, she took a cautious bite, and was immediately 
                    entranced. Her taste buds were flooded by a tsunami of sweetness, growing sweeter with every bite, and a glimmer overtook her eyes the more bites she took.
                    Each bite was better than the last, and when she was done, she discarded the seed in the center, like it was second nature. As she grabbed for another, 
                    the tartness hit her, and it was even better than the sweetness. “Glad you like them. After all, they are His favorite fruit.” The old man was coming back
                    from his harvest, each hand carrying a basket full of fruit. The woman quickly turned around, fruit in hand, and looked embarrassed. “I was, uh, I was 
                    coming to see if you needed some help, and I got a, uh, little distracted.” She sheepishly looked at the ground, hands behind her back, but she looked
                    up when she heard  him say “Oho ho ho, there’s no need to be so embarrassed, you’re free to take as many as you want.” The old man put one of the 
                    baskets on the ground.
                “Are you sure?”
                “Of course,” he said with a soft smile. “After all, they are pretty delicious.” He then picked a fruit from the nearest tree and took a few bites from it.
                With a soft smile and even softer eyes, she looked at the fruit in her hands, admiring it. In the midst of her admiration, however, a random recollection 
                occurred. “Oh, didn’t you say you were going to show me around yesterday?”
                After finishing the fruit, the man inquisitively ran his finger and thumb across his chin, before he had his small eureka moment. “I did say that didn’t 
                I,” he picked up the grounded basket. “Let me put these away, and then I’ll give you the tour.”
                With a another warming smile, she responded “Of course.”
                The wait didn’t last long, and the man soon rejoined her at the edge of the orchard. “Well, as you know, this is the orchard, where His favorite fruit
                grows, and pretty much the only source of food around here, besides hot chocolate.”
                The woman took a long look at the trees around her, listening to the man.
                “Next up, I’ll show you the lake.” The man began to walk towards the next stop.
                With a nod, she followed him with light and springy steps, eager to learn more about the garden.
                As they approached the lake, the breeze grew stronger, blowing the woman’s platinum blond hair around, and the clouds began to amass, which turned the 
                sky into a light grey. The woman, too, started to feel unease grow in her heart, distracting her from the fact the lake grew closer. She hadn’t felt 
                this unease before, but it was telling her something might happen. As she was wondering what this unease was, the old man announced their arrival. 
                “Here we are, the lake.” Said the man with an announced voice and gesture, trying to be heard over the quickening wind. The woman was snapped out 
                of her distraction and looked out over the lake. If the tree on the hill was like a king, the lake was like a god. It stretched out over the horizon, 
                making her wonder if the wall of trees enclosed this god to His garden. While the lake was large, it was fairly shallow, and through the crystal-clear
                water, she could see the sandy floor. While gazing at the floor, she noticed something, and the man noticed her curiosity. “Wasn’t expecting to see 
                anything in the lake, I take it?”
                The woman gave a nod. “I figured the only living things here were the plants and us.”
                “Oh, ho ho,” the man chuckled. “Sometimes you have to take a closer look to see more details.”
                What had caught the eye of the woman was the inhabitants of the lake. Prowling as much of the lake as they could were crabs and catfish, digging 
                through the sand, trying to unearth something. Thinking back to their conversation earlier, she asked the man a question. “I thought you said the 
                only source of food here was the orchard. What about these guys?”
            “Well, we don’t have anything here to catch them,” he responded.
            “Really?”
            “Yes, really,” he answered. “There aren’t any fishing poles or cages to catch them in, so I never bothered to try.”
            After a brief second, the man also added “After all, maybe they are important to Him in some way.”
            She began to think about his answer, but a visitor decided to join them. One of the crabs seemed to have noticed the two of them standing there, and 
            decided to move closer to the surface. The woman noticed, and she too, knelt down, and put her hand into the water. As gently as they both could, the 
            woman’s finger and the crab’s claw touched, and the woman gave a soft smile, melting some of her unease. The moment lasted a while longer, and as the 
            man put his hand on her shoulder, he said, “Come, we still have one more place to go.” The woman gave an affirmative nod, shaking the grin off her face
            as she stood up and began to walk with the man to the last place to visit. As she walked away, she felt the unease return, and began to look at the 
            fruit in her hand, contemplating why she was here. The crab that held her finger sunk to the bottom, looking up at the surface, feeling like it lost 
            something important, but it couldn’t figure out why.
                The wind picked up into gusts that howled past their ears, and the light gray sky turned into a dark gray, and rain began to bombard His garden. By
                the time they reached their final destination, there was a full on storm happening. “Here we are, the flower hill!” The man yelled with a solemn
                face. Drenched in rain, the woman looked at what was before her. Hundreds of thousands of flowers were bombarded by the rain. What surprised her
                The most amidst her growing unease, however, was the colors. Almost every flower was a deep blue, and the flowers that weren’t blue were a bright
                red. With the rain and the wind, it made the flower garden a sea of sorrow with pockets of muted flames here and there, the sound of the crying 
                leaves its waves, and she felt lost. There was something else, however, that caught her eye. At the top of the hill was a patch of white flowers,
                surrounding the tree, calling to her like a lighthouse. The uneasiness she felt began to swell, her heart started to pound, and every time she gasped,
                she fought back tears as her jaw would shake. All the while, the white flowers danced in the breeze, alluring her to the top. The old man looked at 
                her with sorrowful eyes, and like before, placed his hand on her shoulder. “Go on, you know what to do.” Her thoughts didn’t understand his words, 
                but her heart did, like an emotional instinct. The old man’s hand was comforting and supportive, pushing her forward. She looked at the fruit in her
                hand, somehow dry in the harrowing storm, and to steel her resolve, she took a bite. As she chewed, the sweet and tart flavors mixed together, and 
                they told her what to do. And so, with a few deep breaths, she walked towards the tree.
                With each step, the rain fell harder, and her heart tried to jump out of her chest. The wind moved her around, treating her as a feather, but she resisted.
                   Pressing forward. She didn’t know why she was here, but she instinctively knew what to do. Step by step, beat by beat, her unease grew, escaping as tears.
                   She didn’t know why, but she knew the pain she felt was His. The leaves whipped in the wind, crying at her to get back, not to come any closer. She didn’t
                   listen, the tears and rain made her blind, but she moved forward. The storm reached its apex, rain became a downpour, the gusts became a jet stream. All 
                   around the garden, everything was wailing. The water on the lake moved violently, the orchard tried to protect their young, and the cottage creaked and 
                   groaned. The old man watched intensely at the scene before him, confident, as the woman crossed the threshold of the leaves. When she crossed, they stopped.
                   The leaves. They stopped. Even with the wind, they stopped, all while the old man looked on at the scene before him with nervousness.
                In a space protected by the canopy of leaves, the woman stood there, tears streaming down her face. She hadn’t noticed, but the leaves had stopped 
                moving, and the wind and the rain couldn’t get in, unless they were allowed to enter. She slowly looked down, looking at the scared flowers, noticing
                they looked like bells. She then looked up at their protector. She didn’t know why, but she felt sorrow from the tree. “Have you failed to protect 
                something before?” When she asked, a bit of rain crept its way into the space, working their way down the branches to the trunk, and then the trunk 
                to the ground. As the rain left streaks of tears, the woman walked forward, closer to the tree. She didn’t know a lot of things about this place or 
                why she came here, but here unease told her to say these few words. 
            “It’s okay.” 
            She got closer. 
            “I know you tried.”
            She reached the trunk of the tree, and knelt in front of it.
            “I’m here now, so it’s okay.”
            She closed her eyes, tears still falling, and gently embraced the tree.
            “I’m here now.” 
            The tree understood those words, and even though it didn’t move, the tree gently embraced her back.
            While the old man was outside, he noticed the storm had calmed down. The howling gusts went back to whispering breezes. The rain eventually faded,
            and the overcast sky began to break apart. The garden returned to a peaceful place, making his smile grow larger. Before him, he watched as the sun
            began to shine onto the tree, glistening off its tear-soaked leaves. At this sight, he kept his proud smile, and a few tears escaped his eyes as he 
            said, “I knew you could do it.”
            
            
            In a place bound by an encroaching sky, the full moon was periodically blocked by the stray clouds, blocking its sight of an apartment complex. The 
            complex was made of cold steel and monotone concrete. All the apartments had a dreary disposition, but none of them were like apartment 234. The apartment 
            belonged to a man named Jack, and the moon light that peered through the windows made the once colorful place even more dull and muted. The blue walls absorbed 
            the moon light, and at the same time, cast it over the dark, leather furniture. Even the basket of plums on the coffee table blended into the blue of the room.
            Throughout the apartment, the sound of grief could be heard. In the bedroom, Jack was awake in the dead of night, head buried in his knees, trying to muffle 
            the sounds of tears. He was thinking about his departed sweetheart. He thought about her favorite places to visit, some of the movies featuring the actors she 
            liked, and the toppings she put on her bagel in the morning. Each and every memory brought along tears and a reminder of how he failed to protect her. He didn’t 
            want to think about them, and yet, he couldn’t stop thinking about them, like he wasn’t allowed to stop. While he gently cried tears of sorrow, the moonlight 
            moved its gaze over to his dresser, pushed up against the wall below the window. On it were two picture frames surrounding a vase with a lone flower. In the 
            frame on the right, an old man in a winter coat, jeans, and a plaid undershirt held up the fish he had just caught, and in the frame on the left was a 
            picture of Jack and his wife and sweetheart, who had platinum blonde hair that he couldn’t feel again. In between the pictures was the flower vase, and 
            in that flower vase, was a single white bellflower, one of his wife’s favorite things, shining softly in the muted colors of the apartment.
